	      <div class="card-body"><p class="pack">Sailing around The Maldives is the ultimate way to see this beautiful and unique part of the world. Although the hotels on the islands offer undeniable luxury, they often don’t deliver on environmental sustainability. Luckily, G Adventures offers a compromise-free combo of comfort and responsible travel—exploring The Maldives aboard a dhoni boat!</p>
		    <p class="pack">The dhoni is a clean, comfortable, and spacious base for your week exploring the atolls. The large rear dining area offers a welcome shady break for delicious meals, all prepared by the (very talented) on-board chef. Nothing works up an appetite quite like a morning in the water, and you’ll need it for the amazing selection of international and local dishes put before you. Dietary needs are considered by letting the team know in advance, and each meal has a wide range of dishes. Eating is a relaxed and informal experience, and a chance to bond with your group and CEO over what you’ve seen that day. All meals are included on the boat, and you can buy alcoholic drinks like wine and beer at the bar. Fresh drinking water is free of charge at all times, along with reusable bottles.</p>>
		    <p class="pack">Snorkelling the clear blue waters is the main event on this part of the tour, and fins and masks are provided. Turtles, dolphins, reef sharks, barracuda, sting rays: we saw an incredible variety of marine life in addition to the exotic fish we swam with each day. The underwater world is a colourful, exciting and endlessly surprising place of wonder. Thanks to its geography and ocean currents the water in The Maldives is warm year-round. What could be a better winter getaway than warm waters and tropical sea life?</p>

	    <div id="collapseTwo1" class="collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo1" data-parent="#accordion1">
	      <div class="card-body"><p class="pack">In what initially felt like cramped space for seven people and a boat that would never stop rocking, my sea legs quickly came back to me over the six days of my sailing trip from Santorini to Mykonos and I really started to take in the sights, sounds and flavours of the islands. It’s the place to slow down a fast-paced lifestyle for a while - and what better way is there to soak up the Greek Islands than by sailboat? Here are five of my favourite moments during my sailing experience across the Greek Islands.</p>>
		    <p class="pack">Walking the Plank</p>
		    <p class="pack">...onto the boat, that is. As it teetered with the waves - and images of tripping and splashing into the cold water ran through my mind - I kept my cool, took a deep breath, and with three big steps, I walked the plank and crossed safely onto the boat. It was now official - I had finally arrived and the islands were mine to indulge.</p>
		    <p class="pack">Getting around by ATV</p>
		    <p class="pack">A cheaper alternative to renting a car, hopping on an ATV was the most liberating way to see the islands, and also the most practical since the single-lane roads can be quite narrow and winding at times. We took our rented ATV out for a spin and managed to see a lot of Santorini in just one afternoon.</p>
		    <p class="pack">Watching the Sunset</p>
		    <p class="pack">The postcards don't lie. In fact, it's even more beautiful in person. White-washed buildings with blue domes overlooking the Mediterranean sea, the sun setting in the distance, onlookers wandering the quiet streets and settling in at cafes...it was a moment to slow down and take it all in.</p>
		    <p class="pack">Swimming in the middle of the Mediterranean</p>
		    <p class="pack">What better way to spend a sunny afternoon in quiet solitude than drifting in pristine aqua waters?</p>
		    <p class="pack">Late-night wine and food</p>
		    <p class="pack">Somehow the taste of good wine and food is made even better when it's 11 PM on a warm summery night on streets lined with outdoor patios and fellow diners all revelling in the night.</p>

	      <h5 class="mb-0"> <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThree1" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree1"> Cuba </a> </h5>
        </div>
	    <div id="collapseThree1" class="collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree1" data-parent="#accordion1">
	      <div class="card-body"><p class="pack">While there’s always a time and a place for planting your butt on a beach chair, if that’s the only thing you end up doing in Cuba, you’ll be majorly missing out. Starting with Havana (or Habana, as it’s known locally), which is trapped in time, complete with its classic cars and the colonial architecture. The city itself is buzzing, since the private enterprise that was restricted in previous years has started to sprout up after Raoul Castro allowed for it in 2008, and entrepreneurial Cubans finding ways to better their lives through business. Plaza Vieja, in the old town, is a bustling square with cafes and bars and a lively evening scene, and there are no shortages of things to do in the capital.</p>
		  <p class="pack">If you head west to Viñales — one of my favourite spots on the island — is home to famous limestone pincushion hills, with fertile fields as far as you can see. It’s a good base if you want some relaxation, beautiful views, and opportunities to visit nearby tobacco farmers and cigar factories. It holds UNESCO World Heritage site status, and offers a number of adventurous opportunities, from rock climbing, horseback riding, and, of course, hiking.</p>
		  <p class="pack">Travelling towards the centre of the island, Trinidad has the cobbliest cobble stone streets I’ve ever walked on — but you might find watching your step difficult to do among the city’s colourful buildings. If you love history, Santa Clara is a must-see to visit some of the sites of the revolution; its streets are haunted by stories of Che, Castro and the others. Santa Clara was one of the least “touristy” spots I visited while in Cuba.</p>

	    <div id="collapseFour1" class="collapse show" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingFour1" data-parent="#accordion1">
	      <div class="card-body"><p class="pack">A favourite amongst yachters and celebrities is glitzy Hvar, which boasts many top-of-the-line restaurants, great shopping, and a busy port. Looming in the distance, perched high atop a hill, is a 13th century fortress, which delivers a bird’s-eye view of the area. It’s also equipped with cannons and a menacing, medieval-era cliff-side prison worthy of exploring.</p>>
		    <p class="pack">Located on the other side of the island is one of the oldest settlements in Europe, the lesser-populated Stari Grad (or “old town”). It was once inhabited by ancient Greeks, then later Romans, and ornate, ancient mosaic floors have been unearthed around the town, along with many other interesting Greco-Roman artifacts.</p>
		    <p class="pack">Although many of these floors have since been covered over in an attempt to protect them, it’s still inspiring to know they lay hidden beneath your feet. With many of the buildings built in the middle ages that are still in use today, you cannot help but become engulfed in Hvar’s rich history.</p>

		<p class="about">100% pure Kona coffee is a rare commodity exclusively grown in north and south Kona. The high elevation, constant cloud coverage and rich volcanic soil from Hualalai Volcano in the upland slopes of Kona create an ideal environment for harvesting this unique Hawaiian coffee bean.</p>
		
		<p class="about">There are hundreds of coffee farms in Kona, from the small art town of Hilo to Kealakekua, and many offer tours to the public. Visit thriving coffee orchards and learn about the meticulous harvesting process. Then explore the coffee mills and see how the beans are processed. The Kona Coffee Cultural Festival held during November in Historic Kailua Village (Kailua-Kona) is a must-see for coffee lovers.</p>
		
		<p class="about">At one time, coffee was grown in every district on Hawaii Island. Today, discriminating growers are reviving this rich tradition. Boutique, award-winning farms can be found in Puna and Hilo. So sip a freshly brewed cup for yourself and experience the rich aroma and flavorful taste that makes 100% Kona coffee so highly valued, then sample a cup from every district to see which subtle variety suits you best.</p>
